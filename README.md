# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a dataset of credit card transactions and employs various anomaly detection techniques to identify potentially fraudulent activities.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. It contains anonymized credit card transactions labeled as either fraudulent or genuine.

## Methodology

The following steps are involved in the project:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the credit card transaction dataset.
   - Preprocess the data by scaling features and handling missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics.
   - Visualize data distributions and correlations.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Select appropriate machine learning models for anomaly detection, such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM.
   - Train the selected models on a portion of the dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize the results using confusion matrices.

5. **Fraud Detection:**
   - Apply the trained models to new credit card transactions to identify potential fraud.

## Results

The project achieved promising results in detecting fraudulent transactions. The models demonstrated high accuracy and F1-scores, indicating their effectiveness in identifying anomalies.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in credit card fraud detection. By leveraging anomaly detection techniques, we can effectively identify and prevent fraudulent activities, protecting businesses and consumers from financial losses.

## Future Work

Future work could involve exploring more advanced machine learning models, incorporating additional features, and deploying the model in a real-world setting for continuous fraud monitoring.
